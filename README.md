# Santiago Pastorino - @spastorino

:wave:, my name is Santiago Pastorino and I'm a software engineer from Uruguay. I'm a co-founder at [WyeWorks](https://wyeworks.com), a [Rust compiler team contributor](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler), [Types team member](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#Types%20team), [RustLatam](https://www.rustlatam.org/) organizer and a Ruby on Rails core team alumni. I'm currently sponsored to work on the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) compiler by [Futurewei](https://futurewei.com/).

## Rust

I mostly contribute to the compiler of the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Here's a summary of my mostly noteworthy contributions:

- Rust Compiler RPITIT refactor - Refactored RPITIT code to lower RPITs in traits as a GAT.
- Rust Compiler MIR - Helped with Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL) implementation; implemented various MIR optimizations including MIR 2.0 Place refactor.
- Rust Compiler negative impls in coherence - Implemented the first version of negative impls in coherence that allowed the Error trait to be moved into core.
- Rust Compiler Const-Eval - Implemented a first minimal version of inline consts RFC 2920.
- Rustc Dev Guide: Leading the working group, writing and helping organizing the documentation effort.
- Lead Rustc Prioritization working group: prioritizing Rust compiler issues, fixed a lot of critical and high priority issues and support for the Rust compiler and Rust Lang team meetings.
- Lead Rustc Meta working group: helped organize the MCP process and the Rust compiler structure.
- Cargo Bisect Rustc: automated the tool to find regressions in the Rust compiler in a simpler way.
- Lead organizer of Rust Latam conference.
